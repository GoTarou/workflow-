### üéØ **Smart Workflow Suggestions**
- **AI-powered workflow recommendations** based on request type
- **Priority-aware routing** (urgent requests get different paths)
- **Confidence scoring** for each prediction
- **Automatic workflow generation** with optimal department sequences

### üìä **Performance Analytics**

## üìä Understanding the ML Model

### How It Learns

1. **Data Collection**: System gathers approval history
2. **Feature Extraction**: Converts approvals to training features
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Learns department transition patterns
4. **Model Training**: Random Forest classifier learns optimal paths
5. **Prediction**: Suggests next best department based on learned patterns

### Feature Importance

The model considers these factors (in order of importance):
1. **Current Department** - Where the request currently is
2. **Request Priority** - How urgent the request is
3. **Step Order** - Which step in the workflow
4. **Request Type** - Category of the request

### Training Data Requirements
